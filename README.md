# Tic-Tac-Toe AI Agents

## Overview
This project develops AI agents for the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe using three different algorithms: Q-Learning, Minimax, and Alpha-Beta Pruning. The goal is to evaluate and compare the performance of these agents in playing the game.

## Features
- AI agents implemented using:
  - Q-Learning
  - Minimax
  - Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning
- Game Application for human players to compete against the AI
- Performance evaluation of agents against each other

## Getting Started
To run this project, you will need:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab. Or you can open it directly in Google Colab
- To run it, please click the cells in the jupyter notebook in order
